  finalText: 'The year is 3753. Time travel has not been invented yet - but in the
    future, it will be.

    Half-human half-robot killing machines have been sent
    from the future, to exterminate the whole of humanity.

    These "bio-machines"
    travel through worm-holes to stay undetected, and use the most peculiar weapons.

    

    You
    are one of the last survivors. While you might not have much of a chance to win,
    you might as well take as many souls with you as possible. If those creatures
    even have souls.

    

    Loot the corpses of the machines to find bio-modified
    organs, which you can attach to your body.

    You may also find weapon attachments,
    that change the behaviour of your firearms.

    

    

    Good luck.'
